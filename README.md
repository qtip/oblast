# Oblast
Unfinished game project

The goal of oblast is to refine resources, buy workers, build cities to refine more resources... until you have 4 more cities than your opponent, so be quick (or blow theirs up with giant death robots if you want to be that way).

- Blue resources let you expand your view of the map allowing you to find the resources you need, build more cities, and find your opponent's cities to destroy them
- Green resources let you build more cities so you can win
- Use yellow resources to bid for more units in the market. Don't let your opponent outbid you for that I-block =).
- Red is for defending and destroying.
